# Client Change-Log: SK Sutras - by Shri Shripad Kulkarni

All notable changes, architectural updates, and releases for **SK Sutras - by Shri Shripad Kulkarni** are documented in this client-facing log.

---

## [v0.1.0-alpha] - 2026-10-19

### Executive Summary of Changes
Initial enterprise scaffolding and core architecture establishment for **SK Sutras - by Shri Shripad Kulkarni**, developed by Hiranyam AI Labs. This release sets up the multi-agent LangGraph orchestration pipeline, dynamic LLM provider abstraction, embedded ChromaDB vector store, SQLite relational persistence layer, WeasyPrint Devanagari typesetting engine, and a device-agnostic Streamlit manuscript review portal featuring an admin-configurable Senior Citizen (65+ Mode) accessibility engine.

### Direct Client/User Benefits & Features Added
* **Dynamic Multi-LLM Runtime Switching**: Full flexibility to toggle seamlessly between commercial LLM APIs (OpenAI `gpt-4o`, Anthropic `claude-3-5-sonnet`, Google `gemini-1.5-pro`) and local offline inference via Ollama (`qwen2.5`) through standardized environment configurations.
* **Device-Agnostic Manuscript Review Portal**: Responsive Streamlit portal designed for desktop, tablet, and mobile browsers with zero technical jargon.
* **Configurable Senior Citizen (65+ Mode) Accessibility Preset**: Enabled by default to provide large high-legibility typography, gentle high contrast, touch targets $\ge 48\times 48\,\text{px}$, and simplified card-based comparative review of Narada Bhakti Sutras and Shandilya Bhakti Sutras.
* **Relational & Vector Data Persistence**: Dual-tier storage ensuring zero data loss:
  * SQLite relational database for tracking manuscript pairs, review statuses, editorial bhashya, and reviewer annotations.
  * ChromaDB vector store for multilingual semantic mapping using `BAAI/bge-m3`.
* **High-Fidelity Devanagari PDF Typesetting**: Integrated WeasyPrint typesetting engine with embedded *Noto Serif Devanagari* font for print-ready manuscript publication.
* **Bi-Directional Human-in-the-Loop (HitL) Interrupt**: LangGraph DAG state machine pausing at human review checkpoints for scholar approval before synthesizing the final comparative *Udyoga Sutra*.

### Issues/Defects Resolved
* Fresh initialization: Addressed architectural requirement for 100% open-source local infrastructure while retaining enterprise LLM flexibility.
* Prevention of accessibility barriers for senior scholars through dedicated large-touch and high-contrast UI modes.

### Data/Knowledge Base Updates
* Initialized canonical raw schema for Narada Bhakti Sutra (84 sutras) and Shandilya Bhakti Sutra (100 sutras).
* Structured multilingual schema supporting English (`en`), Hindi (`hi`), and Marathi (`mr`).

### Validation & Test Results
* **Test Suite**: Automated `pytest` suite covering Pydantic schema validation, TypedDict graph states, SQLite repository transactions, vector store indexing, and accessibility toggles.
* **Quality Gate**: Passed with zero defects across unit, integration, and state transition test suites.

### Deployment Details
* **Environment**: Local Staging / Test Environment (Workstation Instance).
* **Target Workstation Directory**: `C:\Users\deshp\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\sk-sutras-by-shri-shripad-kulkarni`
* **Release Status**: Initial Scaffolding Complete & Ready for Model Ingestion.
